## DATE: 11/05/2025
## AIM:
To write a C program to find sum of digits.

## Algorithm
1.Start the program and declare variables to store the number and sum.

2.Read an integer input from the user.

3.Use a loop to extract each digit using modulus and division.

4.Add each digit to the sum variable.

5.Print the sum of digits and end the program.

## Program:
```

#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    int num, sum = 0, digit;
    scanf("%d", &num);

    while(num != 0)
    {
        digit = num % 10;
        sum += digit;
        num /= 10;
    }

    printf("Sum of digits: %d\n", sum);

    return 0;
}

```
